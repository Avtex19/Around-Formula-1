        Season 2021 was one where Max went from a consistent podium presence capable of occasional giant-killing results into a bona fide world championship contender.The list of firsts were many, mostly because Max spent so much of the season finishing first. A first win on the most famous city streets of all in Monaco, a first hat-trick of wins in France, Styria and Austria (leading all 142 laps across two memorable races at the Red Bull Ring) and a first win in the United States were highlights, but it would be hard to top his domination of his home race at Zandvoort in September, where he took pole and won the race in front of a frenzied orange-hued adoring home crowd.Max then finished on top of the world for the first time, securing his first Formula One world title in the final race of the season in Abu Dhabi. The following season saw Max assert his dominance over the sport, retaining the world title with four races to spare and surpassing the record for most wins in a season – which Sebastian Vettel and Michael Schumacher had jointly held.

        The 2022 championship has been a much easier time for the Dutchman by comparison. Though he failed to finish two of the opening three rounds due to reliability trouble, Verstappen has taken 12 wins thus far, with his win in Suzuka proving enough to take the title. With a second crown to his name, it remains to be seen how many more he can add to his tally.
