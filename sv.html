        Vettel became the youngest driver to take part in a grand prix weekend when he drove for BMW-Sauber in Friday practice in Turkey in 2006 aged 19 and 53 days.-- He then made his Formula One race debut with BMW-Sauber at Indianapolis in 2007 when he replaced the injured Robert Kubica. He finished eighth, becoming the youngest driver to score a point aged 19 and 349 days.He took part in seven races in 2007 with Toro Rosso.The German was handed a full race seat with Toro Rosso for 2008 and failed to finish his first four races. He then won the Italian Grand Prix at Monza from pole position. That made him the youngest driver to start on pole (21 years and 72 days) and also the youngest ever winner (21 years and 73 days).
        Vettel switched to Red Bull for 2009 after Britain’s David Coulthard retired. He won four races in 2009, including Red Bull’s first victory at the Chinese Grand Prix where he also secured the team’s first pole position and led their first one-two finish. Vettel ended up overall runner-up behind Brawn’s Jenson Button.In 2010, he took 10 pole positions and won five races.
